///   - `auth_cache`        — authentication token cache
///   - `*_cache`           — transient caches, not user preferences
///   - `genre_catalog`     — AniList's genre list, re-fetched on demand
///   - `download_prefs`    — holds the download LOCATION, which on a custom
///                           folder is a device-specific SAF `content://` URI.
///                           Restoring it onto another phone points downloads
///                           at a folder that does not exist and cannot be
///                           written. Add only with per-key handling.
///   - `pinned_sources`, `subscriptions` — reference source ids the restoring
///                           device may not have installed
