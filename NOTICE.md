  License: GPL-3.0
  Zangetsu bundles the CloudStream `library` artifact and includes app-internal
  compatibility classes under the `com.lagradost.cloudstream3` namespace so that
  CloudStream `.cs3` extensions load and run against it. Because CloudStream is
  licensed under GPL-3.0 (copyleft), Zangetsu as a combined work is likewise
  licensed under GPL-3.0.

Aniyomi / Tachiyomi

  https://github.com/quickdesh/Animiru        (extensions-lib v17 API files)
  https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon           (Mihon manga-source runtime)
  License: Apache-2.0
  Portions of the Android extension-loading code (files under
  android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/spyou/watch_app/aniyomi/) are derived from
  Aniyomi/Tachiyomi and retain their original Apache-2.0 headers.

  The vendored extension runtime under
  android/app/src/main/kotlin/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ is likewise derived from
  Aniyomi/Tachiyomi and Mihon. Its extensions-lib v16 baseline comes from
  itsmechinmoy/Dantotsu, and the extensions-lib v17 API files added on top of
  it are copied verbatim from quickdesh/Animiru branch animiru-new-main, path
  source-api/, pinned at commit 662e889c9cc8d4be7990f5c130767fc32f182318:
  animesource/model/{AnimeRelation, SAnimeEpisodeUpdate, SAnimeSeasonUpdate,
  ThumbnailInfo}.kt and util/JsonExtensions.kt.

  Two v17 files are not vendored (HttpServer, VideoInfo) and AnimeSource.kt
  carries deliberate deviations, so the vendored surface is v17 minus HttpServer
  rather than a verbatim v17. See the "Deviations" section of the full
  attribution for the reasoning and for a known runtime limitation that follows
  from the missing HttpServer. The full attribution, per-file provenance, and
  the commit pins for every vendored tree, are in
  docs/licenses/aniyomi-extensions-lib-NOTICE.md. The full Apache License 2.0
  text is included as LICENSE-Apache-2.0.txt.

  The Mihon manga-source runtime, which lives under that same
  eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ path, is a separate ecosystem on a separate version
  line and was not touched by this change.

Other dependencies (Flutter/Dart packages and Android libraries) are used under
their respective open-source licenses; refer to each package for details.

Keeping this file current
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Any pull request that adds a new third-party dependency, incorporates code
derived from another project, or bundles another project's assets must update
this file in the same PR — see CONTRIBUTING.md. This file is treated as the
authoritative record of what's bundled and under what terms; if it's out of
date, that's considered a bug, not a formality.
